## Backstory
I randomly needed a single place to quickly and easily get my clothes organized, to 
understand what replacements I needed, what was missing, and what I could get rid of. When i searched online
for some service I didn't really find anything suitable or free AND good enough, so I just thought
"you know what, let me make something myself".

This is the final result, made in just a couple of days. The longer part will be adding all the clothing items 🤦

## Additional notes
If you want to fork and make your own version, feel free to, just remember to credit this repo somewhere.

The code is a bit messy as I just wanted to have the final product immediately, also some things could have been done 
much more efficiently and/or better, but for now it works pretty well so that's what matters I guess.

Maybe if I have time in the future I will be able to revisit this project to refactor the codebase, and who knows, 
maybe add some new features too (*cough* auth *cough*, outfits *cough*...)
